# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications using modern development practices. Through this project, learners will deepen their understanding of backend architecture, database design, API security, and collaborative workflows.

## Project Goals
- Simulate real-world software development and team collaboration.
- Design and implement robust backend systems and relational databases.
- Apply advanced security measures to protect user data and transactions.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for efficient and reliable deployment.
- Document and plan complex software projects effectively.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:**  
  Enables users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the platform, protecting personal information and allowing users to view and manage their bookings and listings.

- **Property Management:**  
  Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings, including details such as descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability. This empowers hosts to control their rental offerings and helps build a diverse and attractive marketplace for guests.

- **Booking System:**  
  Lets users search for available properties, make reservations, and manage their bookings. This streamlines the reservation process for both guests and hosts, handling availability, payment processing, and booking confirmations efficiently.

- **Search and Filtering:**  
  Provides advanced search capabilities, enabling users to filter properties by location, price, amenities, and dates. This helps guests quickly find listings that match their preferences, improving the overall user experience.

- **Review and Rating System:**  
  Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties and hosts after their stay. This builds trust within the community, encourages high standards, and helps future guests make informed decisions.

- **Payment Integration:**  
  Facilitates secure online payments for bookings, supporting multiple payment methods. This ensures smooth and safe financial transactions between guests and hosts, enhancing reliability and trust in the platform.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, manage business logic, and handle API requests.

## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is structured to efficiently manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and their relationships:

- **User**
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - Description: Represents guests and hosts. A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

- **Property**
  - Fields: `id`, `owner_id` (User), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`
  - Description: Represents a rental listing. Each property is owned by a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

- **Booking**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  - Description: Represents a reservation made by a user for a property. Each booking is linked to one user and one property.

- **Review**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Description: Represents feedback left by a user for a property. Each review is linked to one user and one property.

- **Payment**
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`
  - Description: Represents payment transactions for bookings. Each payment is associated with a specific booking.

**Entity Relationships:**
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (one-to-many).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (one-to-many).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews** (one-to-many).
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property** (many-to-one).
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property** (many-to-one).
- A **Payment** is linked to a single **Booking** (one-to-one).

This relational structure ensures data integrity and supports the core features of the Airbnb Clone Project, enabling efficient management of the various entities and their interactions within the application.

## API Security

To protect the integrity and privacy of the Airbnb Clone platform, several key API security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication:**  
  Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints by verifying their identity through secure login mechanisms (such as JWT or OAuth). This is crucial for protecting user accounts and personal data from unauthorized access.

- **Authorization:**  
  Restricts access to resources and actions based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents users from performing actions they are not permitted to, such as modifying other usersâ€™ data or accessing sensitive information.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Limits the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a certain timeframe. This helps prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) incidents, ensuring the platform remains available and responsive.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  
  All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and maintain data integrity. This is essential for protecting the database and application from malicious input.

- **Secure Payment Processing:**  
  Payment data is handled using industry-standard encryption and trusted third-party payment gateways. This ensures that sensitive financial information is protected and transactions are secure.

Implementing these security measures is vital for safeguarding user data, maintaining trust, and ensuring the reliability and safety of the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. By automatically running tests and deploying updates whenever new code is pushed to the repository, CI/CD pipelines help catch errors early, reduce manual intervention, and ensure that the application remains stable and reliable.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate testing and deployment processes, while **Docker** ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline increases development efficiency, minimizes deployment risks, and accelerates the delivery of new features.
