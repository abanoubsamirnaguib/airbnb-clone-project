# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications using modern development practices. Through this project, learners will deepen their understanding of backend architecture, database design, API security, and collaborative workflows.

## Project Goals
- Simulate real-world software development and team collaboration.
- Design and implement robust backend systems and relational databases.
- Apply advanced security measures to protect user data and transactions.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for efficient and reliable deployment.
- Document and plan complex software projects effectively.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, manage business logic, and handle API requests.

- **MySQL:**  
  A relational database management system used to store and manage application data securely and efficiently.

- **GraphQL:**  
  A query language for APIs that enables flexible and efficient data retrieval between the frontend and backend.

- **Docker:**  
  A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

- **GitHub Actions:**  
  A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment processes for the project.

- **Git & GitHub:**  
  Version control tools used for source code management and team collaboration.

These technologies work together to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable Airbnb clone.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:**  
  Designs and implements the server-side logic, APIs, and business rules. Ensures the backend is robust, scalable, and secure, and integrates with the database and external services.

- **Database Administrator (DBA):**  
  Plans, creates, and manages the database schema. Responsible for data integrity, performance optimization, backups, and ensuring secure access to data.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment environments, and ensures smooth integration and delivery of code. Handles containerization and infrastructure automation.

- **API Developer:**  
  Designs and documents the API endpoints (e.g., GraphQL), ensuring they are secure, efficient, and meet the needs of frontend and backend integration.

- **Project Manager:**  
  Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures project milestones are met. Facilitates communication and resolves blockers to keep the project on track.

- **QA Engineer:**  
  Develops and executes test plans to ensure the application meets quality standards. Identifies bugs and works with developers to resolve issues before deployment.

Each role collaborates closely to deliver a secure, scalable, and feature-rich Airbnb clone.

This project encourages best practices in software engineering, focusing on scalability, security, and teamwork.
